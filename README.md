A project I did for my internship at Polytechnic Institute of Guard in 2021

SUBJECT INTRODUCTION: The world produces 2.01 billion tons of urban solid waste per year. With the rapidly increasing world population, the increase in people's needs has forced businesses and individuals to consume more resources. This situation causes the deterioration of the natural balance, the reduction of natural resources and their damage.

The wastes produced in Over the World constitute an important environmental problem. Uncontrolled rapid economic growth, urbanization, population growth and rising welfare level in the world gradually increase waste production. In general, wastes are not given much importance, but the collection and recycling of wastes such as glass, metal, plastic and paper is very important for a sustainable future.

Today, recycling has gained great importance. In general, good management of waste is important for the sustainable use of natural resources and is a fundamental factor in providing a better quality and sustainable living environment for current and future generations.
 With the collection and recycling of waste, our natural resources are protected and energy savings are achieved. It also helps to protect environmental health.
In this study, I will mention that today's waste separation methods are very primitive and need to be improved.
